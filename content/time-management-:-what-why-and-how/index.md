Recently I’ve finished reading a full article on **Time Management** and I was kind of mind blown after finishing that. And suddenly I’d remembered one of the wisest man’s saying i.e. “We learn when we teach, not when we read”. And this is why I’m ready to give you a summary of what I’ve learnt throughout my journey and what might help people around me to become more awesome by gaining those skills. So, what are we waiting for? Let’s start!

### Spend Time to Save Time

Effective time management allows us to increase our productivity and decrease the amount of stress in our life. If we can learn how investing time properly to improve our skills in any particular area can help us saving time in the long run.

Many people around us think that they are good at managing their time because they are getting things done in an efficient way. But if we aren’t doing the right things, we’ve fallen into the common trap of confusing efficiency with effectiveness. This are two complete different things and we should understand what they really mean! Effective time management means knowing what’s important and focusing on those items rather than the insignificant ones. It doesn’t matter how well we do routine on unimportant tasks which are time wasting activities.

There is nothing worse than getting to the end of the day feeling we’ve achieved little or nothing or we could do better. This feeling is the worst of all for getting one down morally and mentally. Making time management work for anyone relies on two key factors; one is how we plan our time and the second is how we implement the detail of what we’ve planned i.e. reviewing our plan by breaking it down to the little pieces and see if the overall process is bulletproof and on right track. So, this process definitely kills time but will surely save a lot of our times in upcoming process implementation phase.
